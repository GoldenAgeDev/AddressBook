# AddressBook

### About: 
This project allowed me to practice connecting to a SQL database using C#, as well as storing data using .csv files. I initially designed the application to work with a local database server, managed with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 
When considering how to release the application, I decided to implement a database that could be packaged directly with the application using SQLite.

### Language/Framework Info:
- C#
- .NET Core 3.1

### Set-up Instructions:
*This is a self-contained release, no .NET framework is required to run the application*
- Download the .zip of master and extract the AddressBook folder to desired location
- Navigate to the Winx64 folder, found within the AddressBook folder
- BookUI.exe will create the initial database (AddressBook.db), if not already initialized, and launch the application

### Usage Instructions: 
- Add, edit, or delete contacts using the buttons/link on the main window
- Create New Contact and Edit Contact will launch new forms for data entry
- Sort contacts by last name, ascending or descending
- Select a contact from the list to see their information

### Known Issues:
- Labels next to entry and display fields may appear cut off
